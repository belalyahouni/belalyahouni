# Hi there, I'm Belal 👋

### AI Engineer | Systems & Inference Optimization

I am a Computer Science student at the **University of Leeds** (First Class Honours) with a deep focus on **Machine Learning Infrastructure**. I have previous experience from internships and projects in building AI solutions, and optimising existing LLMs to improve inference perfromance.

### 🚀 Current Focus Areas

### Dissertation: Making Mixture-of-Experts inference more viable on VRAM constrained systems.

Developing a novel dynamic KV-cache / Expert weight memory allocator (based on workload) with a unified paging systems (built on top of vLLM) to make inference more resource-efficient.

### 🛠️ Featured Repositories

* **[Dissertation](https://github.com/belalyahouni/Dissertation)**: My ongoing research into optimizing MoE LLM inference. I am developing dynamic memory allocators to manage offloading strategies between KV cache and experts on limited hardware.
* **[containerised-nvidia-dynamo](https://github.com/belalyahouni/containerised-nvidia-dynamo)**: A CLI tool that consolidates 6 manual setup steps into a single command. It provides a ready-to-use Docker environment for running NVIDIA’s Dynamo inference framework with a vLLM backend.
* **[semantic-repo-search](https://github.com/belalyahouni/semantic-repo-search)**: A local RAG-style pipeline for navigating large codebases.
    * *Performance:* Achieved sub-40ms retrieval across 3,500 files using FAISS and FastAPI.
    * *Privacy:* Runs entirely locally to avoid cloud data exposure.
* **[Finetune-model-cosqa](https://github.com/belalyahouni/Finetune-model-cosqa)**: Fine-tuned **DistilBERT** on the CoSQA dataset using Multiple Negatives Ranking loss, achieving significant gains in Recall@10 and nDCG@10 for code retrieval.
* **[attention-is-all-you-need](https://github.com/belalyahouni/attention-is-all-you-need)**: A from-scratch PyTorch implementation of the Transformer architecture (Multi-head attention, positional encoding) trained on WMT14.
* **[AZURE-DS-CWK](https://github.com/belalyahouni/AZURE-DS-CWK)**: Serverless IoT pipeline on **Azure Functions**. Handles high-velocity sensor data ingestion into Azure SQL with real-time statistical aggregation.
